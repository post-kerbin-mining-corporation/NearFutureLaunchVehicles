==================================



============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- B9PartSwitch (1.9.0)
- ModuleManager (v2.8.1)

- Community Tech Tree (v3.0+)

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Near Future Launch Vehicles before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place engines in various high tech nodes.
